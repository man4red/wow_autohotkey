# wow_autohotkey
Simple autohotkey script that will infinitely repeat the key you hold with a small random delay (0.03-0.78 sec) after a small wait delay (0.5 sec). First key press will be also counted.  

Example:
1. Key "1" is pressed -> Key "1" with an action "down" will be sent
2. If key "1" held more than 500ms -> Key "1" will be sent with a small delay until key is released
3. If key "1" released > Key "1" with an action "up" will be sent

It could be useful for the games where you should furiously press dam buttons ASAP
